<h1 >  COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT WEBPAGE </h1>

<p >  Welcome to the website of the Computer Science Department at George Mason University! With 50 faculty members, the CS Department at Mason is the largest department in the Volgenau School of Engineering, one of the largest departments on campus, and one of the largest CS departments in the Commonwealth of Virginia. </p>

<p> Computer scientists must be well-grounded not only in the theory of computing, but also in its application to diverse areas.
Computer scientists must be capable of working closely with members of other professions associated with computing.
Students who pursue this discipline will learn about programming languages, data structures, algorithms, operating systems, artificial intelligence, robotics, data mining,
computer networking, cyber-security, databases and software engineering. </p>

<h2 class="special"> COURSES </h2>
<p> Graduate classes are offered in the late afternoon and evening to accommodate the professionally employed students. Financial aid in the form of graduate assistantships may be available for full- time degree-seeking students. Appropriate courses may be transferred, with advisor approval, into the degree program.

Undergraduate students in CS or IT at George Mason University may also enroll in an accelerated MS as part of their BS degree.

The department offers a wide range of masters programs: Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Security and Assurance, and Software Engineering. The Department also offers additional graduate certificates in a variety of topics; course work toward the certificates can be used for credit toward various Masters programs. </p>
